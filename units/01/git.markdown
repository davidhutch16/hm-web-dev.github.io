# Exercise: Git and Markdown

## Git

Git is a **version control system** that allows you to track changes in your code. It is a powerful tool that allows you to collaborate with others and keep track of your work.

Please download [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for this class.

The worksheet to get familiar with git is found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16eDSAfrorclGoPJQRWv693jxLOw_oMpGFknD9KiqO3E/). This offers steps on how you can use git in the terminal - you may also use a GUI if you prefer. VSCode for example has a built-in graphical interface that you can use if the terminal is not your thing (search for ).

Remember: 
- add,
- commit,
- then push!!
- and if you can't push... *pull*, 
- then push!!
- and if you can't push... **merge**!
- then push!!

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format your text. It is used in many places, including GitHub, to format text.
BLAHBLAHBLAH.

## Exercise 

1. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com) with a README.md file in it.
2. Clone the repository to your computer - click on the green "Code" button.
3. Using your IDE, write a short paragraph about yourself in the `README.md` file with a header and some formatted text. If you wanna get funky with it, add some images and such.
4. Add, commit, and push the changes to the repository.
5. View the changes on GitHub and notice how the text is formatted! :)
