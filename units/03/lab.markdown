## Project Proposals

You are going to be writing your FINAL project proposals which will be due before break. This should be something you're expecting to write the front end and the back end for with your team. Scope it to something to be completed by the end of the year.

## Task

As a team, submit a document that answers the following questions.

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics outside of what we've learned / going to learn will you need to learn to complete your project? Link to resources you've found.
4. What do you need to code for your front-end application? (All projects need some front-end unless you get teacher permission otherwise!)
5. What do you need to code for a back-end application / storage? (All projects need some back-end)
6. What other ideas did you consider but didn't end up doing? (you can provide a link to a live collab)

## Lab 3 Deliverables (after break)

You are free to start working on coding your project after I give you approval of your proposal (which will officially be after break). For Lab 3 specifically, you will only be building the backend. You will have to complete code for **3 endpoints** with your team. We will be implementing the rest of our proposals as we progress through the rest of the school year.

### Example

Here is an example of a [project](https://github.com/hm-web-dev/api-lab-example) based off the proposal in the `README` file.
