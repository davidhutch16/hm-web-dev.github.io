## Project Proposals

You are going to be writing your FINAL project proposals which will be due before break. This should be something you're expecting to write the front end and the back end for with your team. Scope it to something to be completed by the end of the year.
The idea, your database and **3 working endpoints** are due for Lab 3 (API). More information for Lab 3 will be provided in the next few days.

## Task

Submit a document that answers the following questions.

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics outside of what we've learned / going to learn will you need to learn to complete your project? Link to resources you've found.
4. What do you need to code for your front-end application? (All projects need some front-end unless you get teacher permission otherwise!)
5. What do you need to code for a back-end application / storage? (All projects need some back-end)
6. What other ideas did you consider but didn't end up doing? (you can provide a link to a live collab)

## Project Deliverables

You are free to start working on your project (but I will give you official approval after break). For this lab specifically, you will be schematizing your stated backend. You will have to complete code for **3 endpoints** with your team dedicated at the end of lab 3. We will be implementing the rest of our proposals as we progress through the rest of the school year.

Here is an example of a [project](https://github.com/hm-web-dev/api-lab-example). The `README` file is a good example of what you should be aiming for as a project proposal.
