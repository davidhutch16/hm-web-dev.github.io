Each team should submit a document that contains the following information. Your responses should be brief (1-2 paragraphs max). You may use bullet points.

## Artifacts

1. Links to your Google Drive / Github / documents
   - should include code, diagrams, meeting notes, etc

## Reflection

1. What has your team accomplished since the last check-in?
2. Recall the goals you outlined in your project proposal. Which goals were **not** completed since the last check-in?
3. Are you still aligned with your initial schedule? (DONE WITH WEEK 2)
4. What issues prevented you from completing these goals?

## Plan

1. How will your team address the issues that came up?
2. What are concrete goals for your team to accomplish before the next check-in? These goals should be small, achievable, and in priority order.

## Present

Each project team will present the following:

   1. What's been accomplished since the last class check-in
   2. Any major issues that have come up
   3. What the goal is for the next check-in

### Reflection

I have added past trades to the backend.

I haven't finished out the entire backend, which requires creating trades in the backend.

I am 1 WEEK BEHIND (or a little more) on my schedule!

- I prioritized other things, honestly, I was more excited about learning about FPDS (Federal Procurement Data System) looking at the DOGE data.
- I also noticed that my backend is not migrated to typescript yet, so I wasn't excited to do that boring / maintenance work (dreading tech debt).

I will finish out testing my backend more this week, specifically adding claiming trades and canceling trades, and if I get blocked again, I will switch over to front end development and build out the Book view a bit more, adding buttons not just to offer a book but to request a book.
