## Before the Presentation

The night before your presentation, you should distribute files to **everyone** in the class (i.e. through github). Make sure your code runs on both Windows and Mac! (e.g. don't commit node_modules, npm will choose the right dependencies for each OS).

Feel free to email me if there's anything you want to set up before class.

## Presentation Structure

Your presentation should be **10-15 minutes**. You do not have to stick to the example timeline given below, but you should cover the same topics!

|Time | Description|
|:--:|:--|
|2 minutes|Introduce the project|
|4 minutes|Overview of project features|
|3 minutes|Bugs, hurdles, and possible extensions|
|3 minutes|Questions from audience|

Your presentation will be cut off at **15 minutes** so that each group has enough time to present.
