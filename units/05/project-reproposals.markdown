## Project Proposals

Now that you have better idea of what a full-stack web app might look like, we will officially start our final project.
You may re-propose an idea you have, and work on this idea. You can work on the idea either individually or in groups (max 3).

PRESENTATIONS will be 5/23. You have 11 full weeks to work until then!
We will have 3 formally graded check-ins at weeks ~3/6/9 to make sure you're keeping up with your timeline.

## Task

As a team, submit a document that answers the following questions.

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics outside of what we've learned / going to learn will you need to learn to complete your project? Link to resources you've found.
4. What do you need to code for your front-end application? (All projects need some front-end unless you get teacher permission otherwise!)
5. What do you need to code for a back-end application / storage? (All projects need some back-end)
6. What is your minimum viable product (MVP)? 
   1. *NOTE:* An MVP can look ugly, or miss a feature that you really want to build, but an MVP is something. And iterating on SOMETHING is easier than coming up with something from nothing!
7. Provide a rough **11 week** outline of your project goals.

Example below (in markdown):
